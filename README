This project is a playground for a MongoDB training session. It showcases some simple queries with some predefined data that emulates a foursquare like system.

We've split this app in two distinct parts, with some general stuff thrown in the mix as well.

* dump
    * This folder contains some test data for the system. Use 'mongorestore dump/' to load the data

* envs
    * Sample environments (in localhost) are shown here. With the scripts you can start 1 or 2 replica sets or even start a shard from those.

* ruby
    * The ruby application, see the README in ruby/README

* scala
    * The scala application, see the README in scala/README
